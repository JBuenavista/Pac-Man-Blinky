# Pac-Man-Blinky
Pac-man  from MIT xPRO Full Stack Developer course, modified and added Blinky character by Joash Buenavista. 

## Description:
This is a demonstration of two characters PAC-MAN and BLINKY chasing each other as friends. This project demonstrates how each character, object, are able to know the limits of the window and then turn in the opposite direction when reached. In addition to moving objects, these objects can change in size when buttons are pressed that trigger the corresponiding functions. The function increases the speed of the opposite character (object) to include their position.

## Disclaimer:
This project was mainly developed by MIT as part of their exercise projects. My part was to complete missing sections of the code to make the PAC-MAN character run. In addition to PAC-MAN, I also added a new character named BLINKY. The project demonstrates my ability to replicate and modify the code on my own. Buttons were also developed by me.

## Installation:
1. From this GitHub Page, click on the button that says "<> CODE". It's a dropdown menu.
2. Select the "Download Zip" button.
3. From your personal computer's download folder, unzip the folder.
4. Open "Pac-Man-Blinky-main" folder
5. Double click "index.html"
6. It should open into a web browser for activity.

## Usage:
The webpage automatically runs as soon as the page is opened. It demonstrates that the characters can grow in size when selecting the corresponding buttons. Every time the "Giant PacMan" or "Giant Blinky" buttons are pressed, the size not only changes but so does their speed. The reset button is there should the two characters get out of hand.
1. There are 3 buttons: RESET, GIANT PACMAN, GIANT BLINKY.
2. RESET resets any changes made
3. GIANT PACMAN makes Pacman bigger and makes blinky run faster. Click it several times to see what happens.
4. GIANT BLINKY makes Blinky bigger and makes packman run faster. Click it several times to see what happens.
